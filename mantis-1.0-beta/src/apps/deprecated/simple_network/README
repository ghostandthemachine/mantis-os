Simple Network README:

Multi thermal network is an app which will test many of the functions 
of MOS. It uses many of the different layers provided by the OS. The
two sending applications (light_send and temp_send) are identical except
that they sample from the light / temperature sensor respectively. There
is an event layer which is used to determine the source, destination
and event type of each packet. This event header along with the sample
is packed into a comBuf and sent out through the net layer. In this
application we use the simple protocol, which appends the protcol
ID and the port we are sending on to the packet before sending it 
out through the communication layer. The sample is obtained using the
device layer. 

On the receive side, we simply do a net_recv on the corresponding 
port which blocks until we recieve a packet. Next we determine that
the packet is meant for the basestation (ID 0), and print out information
based on which type of event it was.
