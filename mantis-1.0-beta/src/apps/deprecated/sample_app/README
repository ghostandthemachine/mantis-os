MST Proto Example README:

This app is meant to be an example of the minimum spanning tree
network protocol (which is a multi-hop network routing protocol) used
in combination with sensor devices. It is very similar to the
mst_proto_example application.

There are two parts to this application, the sending node(s) and the base.

Sending (sample_app_send.c):
This application has two threads, one thread which formats packets to be
sent out using the event layer on top of the minimum spanning tree which
fits into the network layer. Data from the light sensor fills the
event structure and the packet is sent sent using the net_send
function. Light strength is displayed on the sending node's LEDs. 

The other thread is meant to show bi-directional communication in that
packets sent from the basestation to an application are handled in this
thread.

Receiving (sample_app_recv.c):

The receiving application additionally has two threads. One of these threads
is the periodic beacon, which sends out a broadcast packet every so-often
so leaf nodes can setup routes to the basestation. 

The recv thread is the one which receives the data (data meant for the 
basestation). As each packet is received, the light value, hop count,
and packet sequence is displayed in the shell. If one node is hopping
off another to reach the receiving node, the hop count increases.
