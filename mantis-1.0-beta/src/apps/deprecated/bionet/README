Bionet README:

The bionet applications are used by the BioNet group at the University of
Colorado, Boulder. They are meant to demonstrate bi-directional communication.

bedrest_sense.c: application which periodically reports light, temp, battery and
calculated acceleration.

bedrest_relay.c: application which can route messages from the bedrest_sense
application to the PC, and messages from the PC (such as to click or change
the LEDs) back out to the nodes.

calibrate.c: This application is used to store the MAX/MIN values of the X/Y 
axis of the accelerometer. This application must be placed on the node, and
the 'calibrate' command must be executed. More instructions will follow on-
screen. If this application is not run, the values reported will be incorrect.

sense.c: DEPRECATED: an older version of the bionet demo as presented to NASA 
in MAY '04.

relay.c: DEPRECATED: the relay application used for the above sensing app.
