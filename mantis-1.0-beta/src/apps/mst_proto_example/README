MST Proto Example README:

This app is meant to be an example of the minimum spanning tree
network protocol (which is a multi-hop network routing protocol).

There are two parts to this application, the sending node(s) and the base.

Sending (mst_proto_send.c):
This application has two threads, one thread which formats packets to be
sent out using the event layer on top of the minimum spanning tree which
fits into the network layer. The appropriate fields in the event structure
are filled out and the packet is sent sent using the net_send function.

The other thread is meant to show bi-directional communication in that
packets sent from the basestation to an application are handled in this
thread.

Receiving (mst_proto_base.c):

The receiving application additionally has two threads. One of these threads
is the periodic beacon, which sends out a broadcast packet every so-often
so leaf nodes can setup routes to the basestation. 

The sink thread is the one which receives the data (data meant for the 
basestation). There is code which is commented out which will print
out each part of the mst protocol packet. Currently the basestation
is setup to forward the packets exactly as they exist over the 
serial line. These packets can be viewed using the gateway which is located
in src/tools/gateway/gateway.py.
