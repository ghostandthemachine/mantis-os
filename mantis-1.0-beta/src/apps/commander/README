Mantis Commander version 0.1

Brief Overview:
This program is part of the mantis distribution. It is used to facilitate 
interation between a nymph and a computer. 

The Setup:
-Put the commander binary (using make load in the appropriate build dir) on a 
 sensor node
-Open the mantis_terminal (the mantis.elf binary in the build/linux/commander 
 directory).
-Plug a serial (DB9) cable from the sensor node into the computer's serial
 port.

-Cycle power to the sensor node, and you will be presented with a prompt.

To see a list of commands, type HELP.
NOTE:
(currently only a few commands are implemented...
 -LEDS simply turns the outer LEDS on
 -LEDS OFF simply turns the leds off
 -HELP displays this liste..

TODO:
  We are working on making the commander a library to privide i/o with any
application. With this setup, we will develop a way for an application to
register commands it wants to accept and which function it wants to execute
when it receives this command.
