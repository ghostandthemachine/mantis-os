Printf application.

This program tests the 'printf' library (use #include "printf.h"). Currently
our printf parser only processes strings (%s), characters (%c) and integers
(%d). 


The Setup:
1. load the printf program on a sensor node (and turn it off).

2. run the mantis_terminal program (build/linux/src/apps/commander/mantis.elf)
to start listening over the uart.

3. Connect the sensor node to the computer's serial port using a standard DB9
cable.

4. Turn the sensor node on, the mantis_terminal program should print out the
test string.
