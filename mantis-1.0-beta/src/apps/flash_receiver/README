This program, along with the included ruby script, can be used to
write data to the TELOSb external flash with the following steps:


1. Compile and load the application onto a TELOSb node.  You can
change where in the flash the file should be stored by changing the
DEST_ADDR macro in the source code.

2. Now that you have the receiver on the node, you can transfer any
file you want to the node:
    ----------------------------------------------
    $ ruby send_file.rb /dev/ttyUSB0
    ----------------------------------------------

    The ruby script will tell you:
    ----------------------------------------------
    using device: /dev/ttyUSB0
    ----------------------------------------------
    
3. At this point, reset the node.  You should see the following output:
    ----------------------------------------------
    flash receiver
    erasing flash.... (long pause) done. Waiting for file.
    ----------------------------------------------
    
4. Enter the path to the file to transfer and press enter.
    ----------------------------------------------
    /home/ledbettj/myfile.txt
    ----------------------------------------------

    The node will now inform you of the status of the transfer, along
    with a happy smiley face.
    ----------------------------------------------
    13652 total bytes to receive (size 4)
    :)13588 bytes left (size 64)
    :)13524 bytes left (size 64)
    (etc...)
    :)all done
    ----------------------------------------------


5. The file has been written to the node's external flash!
