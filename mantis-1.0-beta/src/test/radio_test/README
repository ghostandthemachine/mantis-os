	generator.c	-Generating/Sending program
	receiver.c	-Receiving program.

PROGRAMS:

generator - This program can be used to generate the numbers 0,1,2,...255,0,1,
  and send them over the radio (via broadcast). 

receiver - This program will look for values over the radio and display the 
  value it receives in binary on the LED's, additionally it will send information 
  over the uart which can be viewed using the receiver program from printf. 

USE:

1.  The generator program should be loaded onto one remote sensor node 
    (typically using 'make load_send') and started.

2.  The receiver program should be loaded onto the receiving sensor node 
    (typically using 'make load_recv') and started.

3.  Lastly, output can be viewed using an xmos process and the commander program.
    Run the mantis.elf program in the build/linux/src/apps/commander directory to 
    get the values that the receiving node gets.
